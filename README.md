# Sasha's dotfiles

.files for zsh, vim, tmux, and other stuff.

To install, run `make install` - it (should) link everything and install VimPlug and oh-my-zsh. The first time you open vim, run `:PlugInstall` to install all the listed plugins.

The prompt as it is uses a slight mod of [sexy-bash-prompt][sexy-bash-prompt], which can be found in etc/.
