# TODO: Eventually, install VimPlug and plugins here
# curl -fLo ~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim

# The first time you open `vim`, enter the command `:PlugInstall` - that'll install all the plugins listed in [vimrc](./vimrc).

# For the `vim-go` plugin, make sure to run `:GoInstallBinaries` on first install.

# For `YouCompleteMe`, see their [installation instructions](https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe#full-installation-guide).
