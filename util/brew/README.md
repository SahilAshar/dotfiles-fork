# Brew

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is currently the package manager I use by default,
although I hope to migrate to [Nix](../nix/README.md) soon.

## Installation

Run:

```sh
> /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

to install `brew`. Then run:

```sh
> brew bundle
```

from this directory to install my preferred set of packages.
